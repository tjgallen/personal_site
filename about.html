        Gardening is one of the greatest joys in my life.  There are few things as thrilling as watching a tiny seedling popping its head out of the dirt to meet the world.  The beautiful thing about growing plants is that they want to live, and despite all of my errors and (sometimes) neglect, they try hard to thrive anyway.  Spending time in the garden is therapeutic, rewarding me with relaxation, peace, and serenity.

        I am a <strong>foodie!</strong>  I especially love learning about healthy foods and nutrition.  I have an embarrassing amount of cookbooks, and yet I keep adding more.  I read them like novels.  Curiously, I rarely follow a recipe.  Mostly I read a bunch of recipes and then kind of wing it, adding different aspects of different recipes to come up with something on my own.

    I have been an avid reader all my life.  I remember being a little pre-schooler, thrilled when a new Dr. Suess book would come in the mail.  The library was my friend from an early age.  I make a three-hour round trip to town twice a week, so I have adapted to listening to audio books.  What a gift!  Thank goodness for the OverDrive app, so I can listen to them for free from my local library.
